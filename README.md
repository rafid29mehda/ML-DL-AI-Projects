## **Spam Email Detection**

### **Project Overview**
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies emails as either "Spam" or "Ham" (non-spam). The project utilizes a large dataset of emails and leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with a Naive Bayes classifier to create an accurate and efficient spam detection system. To ensure fair representation of both classes, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to balance the dataset, allowing the model to better distinguish between spam and ham emails.

### **Techniques and Tools Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation
  - `nltk` for text preprocessing (stopwords and lemmatization)
  - `tqdm` for progress tracking during preprocessing
  - `imbalanced-learn` for SMOTE class balancing
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Model**: Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorizer with n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC Curve, and AUC Score

### **Dataset**
- **Source**: The dataset contains a total of 83,448 emails with 39,538 labeled as ham and 43,910 labeled as spam.
- **Structure**:
  - **Label**: Indicates whether an email is spam (`1`) or ham (`0`).
  - **Text**: The body of the email content.

### **Project Workflow**

#### **1. Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - **Loading**: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and column names were standardized (`label` to `spam` and `text`).
   - **Text Cleaning**: A custom preprocessing function was created to:
     - Remove punctuation.
     - Remove stopwords using NLTK.
     - Apply lemmatization to convert words to their base forms.
   - **Progress Monitoring**: The `tqdm` library was used to add a progress bar to monitor the preprocessing of over 80,000 emails.

#### **2. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF with n-grams**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization was employed to convert text data into numerical format. To capture more context within the emails, bi-grams and tri-grams were included.
   - The resulting TF-IDF vectors serve as inputs for the Naive Bayes model.

#### **3. Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE**
   - The dataset was initially imbalanced, with more spam emails than ham.
   - SMOTE was used to oversample the minority class (ham) to balance the dataset, which helps in reducing bias and improving the model's ability to generalize.

#### **4. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - The Naive Bayes classifier was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness for text classification.
   - Grid Search was used to tune the `alpha` parameter of the Naive Bayes classifier, optimizing for recall to ensure spam detection is prioritized.
   - The best `alpha` parameter was found to be `0.1`, which improved the model's recall rate.

#### **5. Model Evaluation**
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Showed high precision and recall, with few misclassifications (42 false positives and 202 false negatives out of 17,564 predictions).
   - **Classification Report**: Reported precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.99 for both spam and ham classes, indicating excellent model performance.
   - **ROC Curve and AUC Score**: An AUC score of 0.9989 suggests near-perfect discrimination between spam and ham emails.

#### **6. Real-time Email Classification**
   - A custom function was created to classify individual email samples. This function preprocesses new emails, vectorizes them using the trained TF-IDF model, and applies the Naive Bayes classifier to predict if the email is spam or ham.
   - A sample email, "Congratulations! You've won a free ticket to the Bahamas. Click here to claim your prize," was classified as spam, confirming the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

### **Results**
- The model achieved an accuracy of 99%, with both high precision and recall. It effectively balances the trade-off between catching spam emails and minimizing false positives.
- The ROC curve further confirmed the modelâ€™s robustness, with an AUC score nearing 1.0, indicating a reliable spam detection system.

### **Challenges Encountered**
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed using SMOTE, which helped the model perform well without bias towards the majority class.
- **Processing Time**: Given the large dataset, preprocessing and vectorization took considerable time, mitigated by using progress monitoring with `tqdm`.

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Exploration of Other Models**: Testing other classifiers, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forests), could yield further improvements in classification performance.
- **Deployment as a Web Service**: The model can be deployed using Flask or FastAPI for real-time spam detection on email platforms.
- **Use of Word Embeddings**: Word embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT could be integrated to capture more semantic information from the text, potentially improving accuracy further.

### **Conclusion**
The project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building a spam detection model using NLP and machine learning techniques. The use of TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, and SMOTE provided a robust solution for accurately classifying spam emails, with strong generalization capabilities validated on new inputs. This project showcases the potential of machine learning to improve email security by efficiently filtering out spam.
